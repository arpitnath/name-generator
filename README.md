# React Developer Skill Challenge

We have a small web application that mirrors the architecture of our life page that you can view at (https://synergyofserra.com).

- Fix this React project so it is building without errors using `npm start`.
- When the project is running again, implement the following User Story.
- Your new Services, Sagas and Reducers should be covered with sufficient test cases.

## As a user, I want to generate random names in the application that are presented to me.

### DODs:

- I can see a "Generate Names"-Button in a new block next to the "Logo Rotation"-Block.
- When I click the "Generate Names"-Button I'm presented with 5 random names (that come from the file `src/assets/data/names.json`).

Complexity: 6h
